# Prereq: Jinja Input Transform on RunConfig

**Source(s):** Group A conversation 2026-05-22 — 2026-05-25; `research_judge_prompts/_input_transform_proposal_analysis.md`, `research_judge_prompts/_input_transform_details.md`; Steve's input_transform proposal (verbatim, captured below); reference/ALIGNMENT.md A0.1
**Author:** Steve + Claude (interactive design)
**Status:** complete — design locked; implementation handed to coding agent
**Type:** Kiln core infrastructure (NOT eval-specific). Evals V2 is one consumer.

---

## TL;DR

- New optional field `input_transform: InputTransform | None` on `KilnAgentRunConfigProperties`. Default `None` = current behavior unchanged.
- V1 ships one concrete transform type: `JinjaInputTransform` — Jinja2 template that projects structured task input into the model-facing user-message string.
- Two Jinja2 usage modes (both in the shared engine): full template render (`StrictUndefined`) for the prompt; single-expression evaluation (default `Undefined`) for value extraction. Both exported as a public API in `libs/core` for any consumer (evals being the first).
- Templating requires structured (JSON-schema) task input. Plaintext input with no transform is the existing identity path — unchanged.
- Missing variables and invalid JSON fail hard pre-inference (deterministic, attributable). This is the right error model for general tasks. Consumers that need softer semantics (e.g., evals' skip-with-reason) wrap the API with a pre-check.
- Engine: Jinja2 `SandboxedEnvironment`. Templates are author-time content but may come from collaborators / shared datasets; sandbox from day one.
- Rendered output is captured in the existing `TaskRun.trace` mechanism (first user message of the trace is the rendered input). No new `TaskRun` field required.
- V1 EvalConfigs and existing RunConfigs are unaffected (`input_transform=None` default).

---

## 1. Goal + Scope

### What this is

A new optional field on `KilnAgentRunConfigProperties` that lets RunConfigs transform the task input into the user-message payload at runtime, using a Jinja2 template. This is a **general Kiln task capability** — any task type can use it, not just evals.

### What this is NOT

- Not a new task input mode. The task's input contract stays the same: plaintext OR JSON-matching-schema, locked at task creation. Templating is a projection OVER structured input, not a peer of plaintext / JSON.
- Not a custom DSL. We use Jinja2 unchanged, with `StrictUndefined` for templates and `SandboxedEnvironment` for security.
- Not eval-specific. Evals will be the first consumer (V2 llm_judge templates, V2 simple-check expression extraction), but the design must serve future consumers (general task prompt versioning, A/B testing, etc.) just as well.

### Steve's proposal (verbatim, for context)

> Context: Kiln tasks currently accept input as either plaintext or JSON-matching-a-schema, with the mode locked at task creation. We're adding Jinja templating. The original plan scoped templates to evals; we've decided instead to make templating a general task-level capability via input_transform, with evals as the first client rather than the owner.
>
> The design:
> - input_transform is an optional field on run config (not task config, not a new input mode). It applies a transformation to an existing task input at run time, producing the model-facing payload. The task's input contract is unchanged — still plaintext or JSON-schema, still locked at creation. We are NOT adding a third input type. Templating is a projection over structured input, not a peer of plaintext/JSON.
> - Engine: Jinja with two non-negotiable settings — StrictUndefined (missing vars must raise, not render empty) and SandboxedEnvironment (sandbox from day one).
>
> The contract: structured input + valid template → rendered prompt; anything else → hard error at config or render time, before inference.
> - Template transforms require structured (JSON) input. Plaintext + no-transform is identity.
> - Invalid JSON or missing variables fail totally, immediately, pre-inference.

## 2. Data Model

### `InputTransform` discriminated union

```python
from typing import Annotated, Literal, Union
from pydantic import BaseModel, Discriminator, Tag, field_validator

class JinjaInputTransform(BaseModel):
    """Render task input via a Jinja2 template, producing a string for the model.
    
    The template is rendered against the task's structured input as the
    rendering context (top-level fields accessible directly — no `data.` wrapper).
    """
    type: Literal["jinja"] = "jinja"
    template: str  # Jinja2 source. Validated at save time.
    
    @field_validator("template")
    @classmethod
    def validate_template_compiles(cls, v: str) -> str:
        from kiln_ai.<path>.jinja_engine import compile_template_or_raise
        compile_template_or_raise(v)  # raises ValueError on syntax error
        return v


def _get_input_transform_type(v):
    if isinstance(v, dict):
        return v.get("type")
    return getattr(v, "type", None)

# Discriminated union; V1 has exactly one member. Add more via Union extension.
InputTransform = Annotated[
    Union[Annotated[JinjaInputTransform, Tag("jinja")]],
    Discriminator(_get_input_transform_type),
]
```

### Placement on `KilnAgentRunConfigProperties`

Add `input_transform` to the existing class at `libs/core/kiln_ai/datamodel/run_config.py:48-97`:

```python
class KilnAgentRunConfigProperties(BaseModel):
    type: Literal["kiln_agent"] = "kiln_agent"
    model_name: str
    model_provider_name: ModelProviderName
    prompt_id: PromptId
    # ... existing fields ...
    input_transform: InputTransform | None = None  # NEW — default None preserves current behavior
```

**Important: NOT on `TaskRunConfig` (parent), NOT on `Task`, NOT on `McpRunConfigProperties`.**
- `TaskRunConfig` (`task.py:63-105`) is the persistence wrapper; the agent-specific configuration belongs in the agent's RunConfigProperties subclass.
- `Task` would tie one transform per task — breaks the "same eval, different judge prompts" workflow (per reference/ALIGNMENT.md C.9).
- `McpRunConfigProperties` does not need this — MCP tools receive raw input.

### Immutability

`TaskRunConfig` is immutable-by-convention (no `frozen=True` on `KilnParentedModel`, but the workflow is create-once / reference-by-ID — same as `EvalConfig`). `input_transform` follows the same convention: changing the field on a saved RunConfig is "don't do that," not enforced by Pydantic.

If we ever choose to enforce immutability on RunConfigs (recommended but out of scope here), `input_transform` participates in that enforcement automatically.

---

## 3. Engine Setup

Both modes use the same `SandboxedEnvironment` instance for consistency. The difference is which API method is used per call.

```python
# libs/core/kiln_ai/<path>/jinja_engine.py  (path: coding agent decides)

from jinja2.sandbox import SandboxedEnvironment
from jinja2 import StrictUndefined, Undefined, TemplateSyntaxError, UndefinedError

# Single shared instance for rendering judge prompts / templates
_template_env = SandboxedEnvironment(undefined=StrictUndefined)

# Separate instance for single-expression extraction with softer Undefined semantics
_expression_env = SandboxedEnvironment(undefined=Undefined)
```

**Why two envs:**
- Template render needs `StrictUndefined` — if a template references a missing variable, that's a bug the user should see immediately. Hard error pre-inference.
- Expression evaluation (used by consumers that pre-check values) needs default `Undefined` — `Undefined` is falsy, distinct from `None` (explicit null vs missing key), composable with `| default(...)` filter. This gives the eval consumer's `required_var` pre-check a clean signal: extracted value is `Undefined` → required check fails → skip the case with a reason.

**Why same SandboxedEnvironment class** — Same security model, same syntax surface, same custom filters (when we add any post-V2.0). The two `env` instances are configuration variants.

---

## 4. Public API

Three public functions exported from `libs/core/kiln_ai/<path>/jinja_engine.py` (final path picked by implementer):

```python
def compile_template_or_raise(template: str) -> None:
    """Validate that the template compiles. Used by save-time validators.
    
    Raises ValueError with the Jinja2 error message if invalid.
    """
    try:
        _template_env.from_string(template)
    except TemplateSyntaxError as e:
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid Jinja2 template: {e.message} (line {e.lineno})")


def render_input_transform(transform: InputTransform, task_input: dict) -> str:
    """Render the transform against the task's structured input.
    
    Returns the rendered string (model-facing user message body).
    
    Raises:
        UndefinedError: if the template references a missing variable.
        TemplateSyntaxError: if the template is malformed (should not happen
            at runtime since save-time validation rejects bad templates;
            included for safety).
    
    Note: `task_input` must be a dict (JSON-schema-matching structured input).
    Templating over plaintext is not supported.
    """
    if isinstance(transform, JinjaInputTransform):
        return _template_env.from_string(transform.template).render(**task_input)
    raise ValueError(f"Unknown transform type: {type(transform).__name__}")


def extract(expression: str, data: dict) -> Any:
    """Evaluate a Jinja2 expression against a data dict and return the result.
    
    Used by consumers that pre-extract individual values from structured data
    (e.g., the evals consumer uses this for `required_var` pre-checks and for
    simple-check `value_expression` fields).
    
    Returns:
        The evaluated value. May be a string, dict, list, int, None (explicit
        null), or Undefined (missing key). Generators are auto-materialized
        to lists.
    
    Raises:
        TemplateSyntaxError: if the expression is malformed (caught at save
            time by consumers that validate).
    """
    import types
    compiled = _expression_env.compile_expression(expression)
    result = compiled(**data)
    if isinstance(result, types.GeneratorType):
        result = list(result)
    return result


def compile_expression_or_raise(expression: str) -> None:
    """Validate that an expression compiles. Used by consumer save-time validators."""
    try:
        _expression_env.compile_expression(expression)
    except TemplateSyntaxError as e:
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid Jinja2 expression: {e.message} (line {e.lineno})")
```

**Why `extract` lives here:** It's general Jinja2 expression evaluation, not eval-specific. Any future consumer (general task input introspection, prompt A/B testing, etc.) gets the same primitive for free.

---

## 5. Compile-Time Validation

### RunConfig save

When a RunConfig with `input_transform: JinjaInputTransform` is saved:

- The `validate_template_compiles` validator on `JinjaInputTransform` runs `compile_template_or_raise(template)`.
- Invalid Jinja2 syntax → Pydantic `ValidationError` → save rejected.

This catches template typos / unclosed blocks / bad filter names at save time, before any runtime invocation.

### Consumer save (informational, not enforced here)

Consumers that hold Jinja2 expressions (e.g., the evals consumer's `value_expression` and `required_var` fields) should run `compile_expression_or_raise` in their own field validators. The prereq infra exposes the helper; consumers use it.

---

## 6. Runtime Execution

### Where in the adapter chain

The transform sits between "task input received" and "input handed to the prompt builder / formatter":

1. Adapter is invoked with the task's structured input (dict).
2. If `run_config.input_transform is not None` AND the task has `input_json_schema` (structured input) → call `render_input_transform(transform, task_input)` to produce a rendered string.
3. Pass the rendered string as the model-facing user message body. From the formatter's perspective downstream, this is just a string input — same as it would have received without a transform.
4. If `input_transform is None` → existing behavior (input passes through unchanged).

The implementer picks the exact insertion point in `libs/core/kiln_ai/adapters/model_adapters/base_adapter.py` (likely inside or before `_run_returning_run_output`).

### Input contract

`input_transform` requires the task's input to be structured (JSON matching `input_json_schema`). Reason: templating projects fields of a structured value into a rendered string. A plaintext input has no fields to project.

**Validation at task association time (recommended):** if a RunConfig with `input_transform` is associated with a task that has no `input_json_schema`, that's a misconfiguration. Validate at the RunConfig-task linking point, OR at the first run attempt.

Implementer's discretion on where to enforce. Both work; first-run is simpler.

### Output contract (V1)

Renders to a string. Future extension (NOT V1): emit structured output (template → JSON for a JSON-schema task). Don't foreclose this in the type signature even though V1 only implements string output. See §11 Open.

---

## 7. Error Handling

All transform errors are pre-inference (the inference call is not made if the transform fails).

| Error | When | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Template syntax error | Save time | Pydantic ValidationError; save rejected |
| Template syntax error | Runtime (shouldn't happen — save-time blocks it) | Re-raise as runtime error |
| `UndefinedError` from `StrictUndefined` | Runtime (template references a missing variable) | Hard error pre-inference. Surfaces user errors so they can fix them. |
| Task input is not a dict (e.g., plaintext) | Runtime | Hard error pre-inference with clear message ("input_transform requires structured task input") |
| Render error (custom filter exception, etc.) | Runtime | Hard error pre-inference |

**This is the general-task philosophy: fail loud, fail fast, fail attributable.** Consumers that need softer semantics (e.g., evals' skip-with-reason) wrap the API with their own pre-check (see §11 Eval consumer).

---

## 8. Persistence

**No new `TaskRun` field required.** The rendered model-facing input is already captured in `TaskRun.trace` (first user message) by the existing trace mechanism.

To inspect what the model received after transform, read `TaskRun.trace[0]` (or whichever message is the first user message — implementer to confirm exact position based on existing trace conventions).

Implications:
- No schema migration to `TaskRun`
- Inspection of "what did the model actually see after templating" is already available in existing tooling

If a future need arises for storing template input separately from the rendered output (e.g., to re-run with a different template version), that's an additive change. Not V1.

---

## 9. V1 Backwards Compatibility

- `input_transform: InputTransform | None = None` — default `None` means no transform.
- All existing RunConfigs in the wild have no `input_transform` field. After this change, they parse as having `input_transform=None`. Behavior unchanged.
- Adapter code that runs with `input_transform is None` skips the render step entirely — identity path.
- No V1 EvalConfig is affected. V1 evals use the existing `GEval` adapter (`g_eval.py`) which constructs prompts via hardcoded f-strings, doesn't go through `input_transform`.

**Per reference/ALIGNMENT.md A0.1: V2 reads V1; V2 never migrates V1. This change is additive — no V1 behavior is altered.**

---

## 10. Security

### Threat model

Templates are user-authored content stored in RunConfig. Risk surfaces:

1. **Local user authoring own templates:** low risk — user has full local access already.
2. **Shared RunConfigs from other team members:** medium risk — a malicious template author could include attribute access on dangerous objects to exfiltrate data.
3. **Templates from public datasets / community libraries:** higher risk — unvetted content.

### Mitigations

- **`SandboxedEnvironment`** — Jinja2's sandboxed environment disallows attribute access on dangerous methods (`__class__`, `__bases__`, `__subclasses__`, etc.) used in known Jinja2 SSTI exploits. This is the standard mitigation for user-authored Jinja2 templates.
- **No file I/O loaders** — we render templates from inline strings only, not via `FileSystemLoader` or similar. No risk of reading arbitrary files.
- **No custom filters with side effects** — V1 ships no custom filters. Future custom filters must be pure (no I/O, no state mutation).
- **Compile-time validation** — catches obvious typos / bad syntax before runtime.

### Out of scope

- Resource limits (CPU, memory) on template rendering. Jinja2's `SandboxedEnvironment` doesn't bound execution time. If a template enters a pathological loop (e.g., user typo combining `{% for %}` and unbounded data), the render call can hang. Future hardening if needed.

---

## 11. Tests

Required validation at implementation:

### Unit tests

- `JinjaInputTransform` field validator rejects malformed templates with a clear error
- `render_input_transform` correctly substitutes variables from a dict input
- `render_input_transform` raises `UndefinedError` on a template referencing a missing variable
- `extract` returns Python objects (string, list, dict, int) per the expression
- `extract` returns `Undefined` for missing keys (default mode, not strict)
- `extract` returns `None` for explicit null values
- `extract` materializes generators to lists (test: `data | map(attribute='x') | list` returns a list, not a generator)
- `compile_template_or_raise` and `compile_expression_or_raise` raise `ValueError` with line/column info on invalid input

### Integration tests

- A RunConfig with `input_transform: JinjaInputTransform(...)` saves, loads, and renders correctly end-to-end
- A RunConfig with `input_transform=None` (or absent) runs through the adapter chain unchanged (V1 behavior preserved)
- Sandbox enforcement: a template trying to access `__class__.__bases__[0].__subclasses__()` raises `SecurityError` (Jinja2's sandbox catches this)

### Backcompat tests

- Existing on-disk RunConfigs (without the new field) load cleanly and behave as before
- A RunConfig saved with `input_transform=None` is functionally equivalent to one with no field set

---

## 12. Eval Consumer (isolated section)

This is here so the implementer knows the constraints from the first consumer, but the eval-specific design lives in `components/40_template_and_extraction.md`. The prereq infra MUST work for evals; the eval design DOC describes how evals use it.

### How evals will consume `input_transform` (high level)

1. Eval runner takes an `EvalInput` + the `TaskRun` being evaluated.
2. Assembles a synthetic JSON document with four fields:
   ```python
   {
     "final_message": str | dict,  # TaskRun.output.output
     "trace": list | None,         # TaskRun.trace (modified OpenAI format)
     "reference_data": dict | None, # EvalInput.reference
     "task_input": str | dict       # TaskRun.input
   }
   ```
3. For V2 `llm_judge` EvalConfigs:
   - The judge runs as a Kiln task. Its `RunConfig` carries a `JinjaInputTransform` with the user-authored `prompt_template`.
   - The eval runner calls `render_input_transform(transform, synthetic_input)` to produce the user message string.
   - Before render, eval runner pre-evaluates each `required_var` expression via `extract(...)`. If any returns `Undefined` or `None`, the case is skipped with `skipped_reason: "missing_required_var:<expr>"` (no template render, no inference). This is the eval-specific soft-fail layer wrapping the prereq's hard-fail engine.
4. For V2 simple-check EvalConfigs (`exact_match`, `pattern_match`, etc.):
   - These don't render templates. They call `extract(value_expression, synthetic_input)` to pull a single value, then compare it to `expected_value` / `reference_data[reference_key]`.

### Constraints the prereq infra must respect

- **`extract` returns `Undefined` for missing keys (not raises).** The eval `required_var` pre-check relies on being able to distinguish "missing" from "present-but-null" without trying-and-catching exceptions on every check.
- **Both `render` (StrictUndefined) and `extract` (default Undefined) use the same engine class** — the eval runner relies on a single security/sandbox surface. If they diverge in capability (e.g., one supports a custom filter the other doesn't), eval consumption will hit weird edge cases.
- **Public API surface** — `render_input_transform`, `extract`, `compile_template_or_raise`, `compile_expression_or_raise` must all be importable from the same module. Evals will import all four.

### What's NOT in the prereq infra (eval-side concerns)

- `EvalTaskInput` Pydantic model — eval-specific assembly, lives in eval code
- `required_var` field, skip semantics, structured `skipped_reason` values — eval-specific
- Simple-check `value_expression` validators — eval-specific
- Reserved-variable rules (`final_message`, `trace`, `reference_data` are always top-level) — eval consumer's convention, not a prereq concern. From the prereq's perspective, the eval runner just passes a dict with whatever keys.

---

## Implementation notes (deferred to the implementing agent)

- **Final module path** in `libs/core` for `jinja_engine.py` (or whatever it's named). Coding agent picks the right location. Suggested: `libs/core/kiln_ai/utils/jinja_engine.py` or similar.
- **Exact insertion point** in the adapter chain for the transform render call. Coding agent picks; likely inside `_run_returning_run_output` or just before formatter assembly in `base_adapter.py`.
- **Plaintext-input validation timing** -- fail at RunConfig save (when the user pairs a transform-bearing RunConfig with a no-schema task) vs. fail at first run. Either works; coding agent picks.
- **Structured output emission** -- V1 emits string only. Don't foreclose JSON output in the future; the V2 `JinjaInputTransform.type` discriminator allows adding a `JsonJinjaInputTransform` later without breaking V1.
- **Resource limits** -- Jinja2 sandbox doesn't bound CPU/memory. If users author pathological templates, render can hang. Defer to future hardening.
